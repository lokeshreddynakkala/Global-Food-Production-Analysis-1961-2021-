# Global-Food-Production-Analysis-1961-2021
Global Food Production Analysis Dashboard (1961‚Äì2021)
üìäProject OverviewThis repository contains the data analysis, methodology, and final Interactive Excel Dashboard for a comprehensive study of Global Food Commodity Production from 1961 to 2021.The primary objective was to transform raw, wide-format historical data into an interactive, user-friendly tool, enabling stakeholders to assess long-term trends, monitor performance, and identify key producers across 22 major agricultural and livestock sectors.
üöÄ Key ObjectivesThe project was structured around five core objectives:Data Transformation (Normalization): Restructuring the wide-format input data (22 commodity columns) into a single, normalized table using Power Query for advanced PivotTable analysis.Trend Identification: Visualizing time-series trends, volatility, and growth rates for all commodities.Comparative Analysis: Ranking and visualizing the Top 10 and Bottom 5 producing countries globally.Growth Measurement: Implementing the dynamic Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth Percentage as a core KPI.Interactive Delivery: Consolidating all insights into an accessible Excel dashboard controlled by dynamic slicers.
‚öôÔ∏è Methodology & Data ArchitectureData SourceFile: world food production.csvTime Period: 1961 ‚Äì 2021Data Size (Pre-Processing): 11,912 rows across 24 columns (Entity, Year, 22 Commodities).Data Size (Post-Processing): Over 262,000 normalized data points.Technical Highlight: Data UnpivotingThe project's architectural success hinged on using Excel Power Query's Unpivot function. This process converted 22 separate commodity columns (e.g., Maize Production (tonnes)) into a single, two-column structure:Food Item (the name of the commodity)Production (tonnes) (the associated value)This normalized structure ensures that all charts and KPIs filter consistently and correctly from a single Data Model.
üìà Dashboard Structure & InteractivityThe final dashboard is organized for intuitive analysis, featuring a single control panel connected to seven visual elements:ComponentPurposeData Fields UsedControl PanelPrimary filtering mechanism.Slicers for Entity, Year, and Food Item.KPIsHigh-level immediate metrics.Total Production (tonnes) and Average YoY Growth (%).Production TrendTemporal analysis.Combo Chart showing Total Volume (Line) vs. YoY Growth Rate (Bar).Ranking ChartsComparative analysis.Horizontal Bar Charts showing Top 10 and Bottom 5 producing countries.CompositionStructural analysis.Donut Chart showing the proportional contribution of selected Food Items.
üí° Key FindingsThe analysis revealed several critical observations regarding the global food system:Strong Long-Term Growth: Global food production shows a persistent, strong upward trend since 1961, largely driven by technological advancements.Concentration Risk: A significant disparity exists, with the Top 10 countries dominating a vast majority of the total global volume.Crop Specialization: Recent decades show a rising dominance and high growth rate in Maize and Soybeans. This increasing reliance on a smaller set of staples introduces a structural risk (monoculture vulnerability) to the global supply chain.Volatile Sectors: The dashboard allows users to isolate commodities highly sensitive to external factors (e.g., Coffee production is frequently characterized by high YoY volatility).
üî≠ Future ScopePotential enhancements to expand the project's analytical depth:Geospatial Visualization: Incorporating a Map Chart to visually display production intensity and concentration globally.Food Security Metrics: Merging production data with consumption, trade, and population data to calculate per-capita availability and self-sufficiency ratios.External Factor Modeling: Integrating climate data (e.g., El Ni√±o events) or economic factors (fertilizer cost indices) to model and predict future production volatility.
üîó Getting StartedDownload: Download the final Excel dashboard file from this repository.Open: Ensure your version of Excel supports Power Query (Power Query Editor) and Data Model/PivotTable functionality.Explore: Use the Slicers at the top of the dashboard to filter by country, year range, and commodity to generate dynamic insights.
