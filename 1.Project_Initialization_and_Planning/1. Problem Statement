The world’s growing population and changing climate are exerting increasing pressure on global food systems. Governments, researchers, and businesses require reliable insights into food production trends to improve planning, sustainability, and food security.

However, the vast diversity of crops and regions makes it difficult to identify which countries dominate certain types of production, how production patterns have evolved over time, and where potential vulnerabilities exist.

This project aims to analyze global food production data (1961–2021) across multiple crops and countries to uncover key trends, identify top producers, and visualize global production patterns effectively.
